An updated version of LRFF is pending Council review in May 2012. The LRFF, with its ten-year revenue and expense forecast, is the foundation on which a proposed budget is built. The forecast is based primarily on the following view: moderate economic growth, a stabilizing economy, tepid consumer spending, relatively high unemployment, and strong corporate profits. Our perspective is that General Fund revenues \"bottomed out\" in Fiscal Year 2011 and are beginning, albeit slowly, to rebound. The concern continues to be expenditures growing at a higher pace than revenues, mainly due to growing pension and healthcare expense.</p><p>In Fiscal Year 2013, $151 million total revenue is budgeted in the General Fund, a $4.5 million (3.1 percent) increase from Fiscal Year 2012 adopted budget. Compared to Fiscal Year 2012 adjusted budget (presented as part of LRFF), they reflect a $0.8 million increase. The General Fund's top five tax revenue sources (property, sales, transient occupancy, utility users, and documentary transfer taxes) combined account for $75.0 million or 50 percent of total projected sources of funds in the Fiscal Year 2013 proposed budget. Based on the recent remittance data, some revenue estimates have moved upward since the original LRFF was published. Staff will provide an updated forecast to the Council in May 2012. In addition, and to bridge an anticipated budget gap, specific revenue categories have been more aggressively budgeted for Fiscal Year 2013. These include the transient occupancy, documentary transfer, and sales taxes. Staff believes the incremental revenue target is achievable should the economy grow more robustly in Fiscal Year 2013 and if current, positive trends in these categories continue.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that exogenous events such as European debt problems, Middle East political and military turmoil affecting gasoline prices, and the vitality of key, foreign economies and trading partners can easily and adversely affect this more optimistic view.</p>",

At the same time, the City continues to implement an aggressive program to upgrade its own water distribution pipelines as well as finishing its multi-year project to rehabilitate, replace and install new reservoirs and wells to bolster our local emergency water supply system. Also impacting costs is the fact that in recent years, actual consumption levels were lower than forecasted, thus, annual revenues have not kept pace with the fixed expenses of the water distribution system.

As of February 2012, there are approximately 7,500 active participants in the PaloAltoGreen Program which represents 24.6% percent of all electric accounts.

This legislation sets a statewide goal to create 3,000 megawatts of new, solar-produced electricity by 2017. By lowering the cost of solar systems to consumers, SB1 aims to put California on pace to build a million solar roofs over the next ten years.</li><li>SB1037 (2005) establishes a statewide \"loading order\" for electric power resources, specifying the following preference hierarchy: first, energy efficiency and demand reduction, second, renewable energy, and third, conventional power supply. This legislation requires publicly-owned utilities to adopt this loading order and to report annually to customers and the California Energy Commission (CEC) on programs, expenditures, and energy savings results.</li><li>AB2021 (2006) built on SB1037, adds new and very specific long-term planning, reporting, and review requirements with specific deadlines, and a requirement to \"treat efficiency as procurement investments\u00e2\u20ac_without regard to previous minimum investments\". AB 2021 requires the Utilities Department to develop and submit 10-year energy efficiency plans to the CEC on a three-year cycle, with annual reports to customers and the CEC.</li><li>AB32 (2006), \"California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,\u00e2\u20ac\u00f9 sets state goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. AB32 requires publicly-owned utilities to report greenhouse gas emissions and empowers the State Air Resources Board to determine the 1990 baseline emissions, to establish emission reduction targets and regulations for reporting, and to adopt regulations for market-based compliance mechanisms.</li><li>AB1470 (2007) requires publicly owned utilities providing gas service to retail gas customers to adopt, implement and finance a solar water heating system incentive program.</li><li>AB920 (2009) requires utility companies to pay households or businesses for any extra electricity produced by the customer's solar power system to encourage more people to invest in solar power while maximizing conservation and energy efficiency.</li></ul><p>In FY 2013, approximately $5.0 million is being devoted to incentives and programs to comply with these laws.</p>",

The Refuse Fund is positioned to have positive cash flow in FY 2013 and subsequent years. The Refuse Rate Stabilization Reserve (RSR) is currently a negative figure due to the requirement for the City to book the estimated landfill post-closure expenses as a liability. Viewing the RSR without this long-term liability, which will be paid out of operating revenues over the next 30 years, yields a current positive Operating Reserve of $1.3 million that will be further improved during FY 2013. A cost of service study for the Refuse Fund was completed in FY 2012. Proposed residential rate increases for FY 2013 utilize the results of the study to begin bringing the residential sector to full cost recovery while increasing the transparency of the rate structure by charging fixed rates for some of the services provided. While residential rates increased by an effective 35 percent from FY 2009 through FY 2011, residential revenues increased by only 18 percent due to the large number of customers who switched to the less expensive minican service as the City encouraged conservation in accordance with its Zero Waste goals. Staff will continue to explore opportunities to reduce expenses and to implement recommendations resulting from the cost of service study during FY 2013.</p>",
